	"description": "<p>Suppose we have a function f such that f(x) is equal to the sum of the digits in x!. for each input Z, find the smallest number Y such that f(Y) = Z. For example, for a Z such as 9, we would list factorials:<br>f(1) =  1<br />f(2) = 2<br />f(3) = 6<br />f(4) = 2+4 = 6</br>f(5) = 1+2+0 = <br />f(6) = 7+2+0 = 9<br /><br />The smallest number whos factorial digits sum to 9 is therefore 6. For this problem, you may assume that all given Y are less than 1,000,000</p>",
